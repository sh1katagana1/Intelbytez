# Domain Infringement
In this lesson I want to go over some methods to monitor for Domain Infringement. Companies have identities, brands, domains, etc. that they need to protect as threat actors try to constantly impersonate them. There is some expensive commercial options, but there is also some low cost/free options you can use to do this task. I want to cover some tools and techniques I use to daily monitor if threat actors are attempting to impersonate the company I work for.
